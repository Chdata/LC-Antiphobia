# LC-Antiphobia
 Chdata's Antiphobia Mod for Lethal Company

 It's a client-side replacement that changes shotguns into trumpets, turrets into basscannons, and beehives into popcorn.

 There is also a nice setting for those with Epilepsy to turn off the spinning fan in the start room.

# Features:
- Fixed Arachnophobia Mode (Removes the spider's fangs floating with the text)
- Trypophobia Mode (Fear or disgust of a pattern of holes - replaces Circuit Beehive texture with wood or replaces the model with popcorn)
- Hoplophobia Mode (Severe anxiety towards firearms - replaces turrets and shotguns with basscannons and trumpets)
- Epilepsy Mode (Disables the fan in the start room from spinning. It also removes the basscannon's particle effects.)

# Installation Instructions
Use your favorite mod manager to install!

You MUST set `HideManagerGameObject = true` in your `BepInEx/config/BepInEx.cfg` file for the sound replacements to work!

Remember your mod manager can open that config in the Config Editor!

The "antiphobia.assetbundle" file belongs in the same folder as "Antiphobia.dll". It contains the model and sounds.

Check out the config file for options to toggle each mode!

# Planned Features:
- ~~Melissophobia Mode (Fear of bees)~~
- ~~Cynophobia Mode (Fear of dogs)~~
- ~~Ornithophobia Mode (Fear of birds)~~
- ~~Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia Mode (Fear of Long Words)~~

I plan to develop this to a certain point that will hopefully work without needing too much maintenance, and then move on to other projects.

# FAQ:
Q. Will you add X phobia mode?

A. Tell me about it on Discord in the unofficial Lethal Company modding community, and I will consider it.

I probably won't do it though. I need to move on to other mods with my limited free time.

Q. Why no Melissophobia Mode?

A. I wanted add it, but I couldn't figure out how to change the bee's graphics through mods.

# Known Bugs:
- I removed the Bunker Spider's fangs outside of Arachnophobia Mode too.
- The Basscannon's particles don't always match up with the Turret's bullets (which are just invisible)
