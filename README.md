# LC-Antiphobia
 Chdata's Antiphobia Mod for Lethal Company

# Planned Features:
- Hoplophobia Mode (Fear of firearms)
- Trypophobia Mode (Fear or disgust of a pattern of holes)
- Melissophobia Mode (Fear of bees)
- Fixed Arachnophobia Mode (Removes the spider organs floating with the text)

I plan to develop this to a certain point that will hopefully work without needing too much maintenance, and then move on to other projects.

# FAQ:
Q. Will you add X phobia mode?
A. Tell me about it on Discord in the modding community, and I will consider it. But I will not guarantee it, I work full time.
